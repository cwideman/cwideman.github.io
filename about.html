            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Aspiring journalist in writing and reporting your most sought out entertainment and news.</h3> <br>
           <p> I discovered my passion for writing my senior year in high school upon applying for scholarships around my community. Since then, my enthusiasm for media and writing has flourished! I am constantly practicing reporting and gaining media related news experience and feedback here at the University of Florida’s College of Journalism and Communications. </p>

            <p> During my graduation year of high school I attended dozens of scholarship ceremonies in which I gave multiple speeches about my high school career and potential future career. After applying for and receiving 20 award-winning scholarships from my community, I was even included in the newspaper various occasions. </p>

            <p>I have worked 150+ hours of community service, including working with the Big Brothers Big Sisters, Habitat for Humanity, and Invisible Children organizations. I have also spent a lot of time and effort with Hospice. Apart from the various services I have conducted, I have also been a member of multiple groups and organizations, including Key Club, the National Honor Society. I am currently also a member of the Florida Opportunity Scholars at the University of Florida. </p>

            <p>Finally, I engage myself in high-strung activities. I love water sports and have a passion for anything that involves receiving an adrenaline rush. My biggest strengths are involvement and familiarity. I never turn down the opportunity to learn through experience. For recreation I jet-ski, water-ski, wake-board, surf, paintball, scuba-dive, tube, canoe, kayak, knee-board, and go spelunking and deep-sea fishing etc. Being a Floridian, I have done a multitude of other activities such as: sailing, horseback riding, four-wheeling, iceskating, karate, wall-climbing, rifle-shooting, go-carting, camping, mountain biking, white water-rafting, and cliff-jumping. </p>

            <p>I am certain that any person with the understanding, experience and acquaintance with a specific area of focus will have the knowledge and ability to easily write about it with the goal to inform others. </p>

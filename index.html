<h1>Tag reference</h1>
<h2>Secondary heading</h2>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>I want <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">these words</a> to be clickable and send me to Google. Tags have one <em> element</em> and zero or multiple <em>attribute</em> and <em>value</em> pairs.</p>

<p>It is common to use <code>target="_blank"</code> for external links. With external links, you need to use <strong>absolute URLs</strong>. Absolute URLs include the full path to an object typically by utilizing <code>http://</code> </p>
